Quote about Learning
keeping positive vibe

“There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.”
— Jiddu Krishnamurti

Assert in Dart
While coding, it is hard to find errors in big projects, so dart provide a assert method to check for the error. It takes conditions as an argument. If the condition is true, nothing happens. If a condition is false, it will raise an error.

example :
void main() {
var age = 22;
assert(age!=22, "Age must be 22");
}
